# OpenCDMS
## Climate and Hydrology Data Management System

OpenCDMS is a Reference Open Source Data Management System for atmospheric,
hydrological, marine, phenological, composition and other environmental data 
with a time-series component. It stores observational data concerning water, 
weather, hydrology and climate in a secure and flexible manner and enables 
extracting useful information from the data. 

OpenCDMS is intended to be used by the National Meteorological and
Hydrological Services (NMHS) of WMO Members, and by any others wishing to
use best-practices in managing and using these data.

Further information will be available from http://www.opencdms.org/ 

The OpenCDMS Project is promoted by the World Meteorological Organization.

The OpenCDMS project welcomes Contributors to get involved and help us.
If you wish to become an OpenCDMS Contributor you will need to fill in and

## Getting Involved

Between July and December 2020 the OpenCDMS Project will focus on the following areas:
| Repository | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| [opencdms-project](https://github.com/opencdms/opencdms-project/issues) | Determining how the project will be managed and high-level discussions |
| [opencdms.org](https://github.com/opencdms/opencdms.org/issues) | The contents of the opencdms.org website |
| [api](https://github.com/opencdms/api) | The API specifications will define universal APIs for interacting with conformant CDMSs. Work on a reference implemetation has started in the [data-api](https://github.com/opencdms/data-api/) and [process-api](https://github.com/opencdms/process-api/) repositories |
| [data-model]() | The early versions of OpenCDMS will operate using existing CDMS data models. Models are being collected and discussed. Future work will include the creation of a next generation data model for OpenCDMS, it is intended that this will be the default data model from OpenCDMS version 2 onwards |
